I am using RidgeReg as the regression model.


getEyeFeats(): 9491

Normalize the eye features.  I think there are something like 70 features coming from the CLM model.

addData(): 9557

There are separate arrays for clicks and for mouse movement (trails).  
Each is currently limited to a 'data window' of the last 700 items.

predict(): 9593



Thoughts

I don't know how well the CLM model, which I believe is providing the basic eye features, works.
The feedback image (face outline) can jump around quite a bit while looking fairly still/closely at a single point on the screen.
I've tested the system where I hold my head still and make small movements. This can keep the feedback steady, but still does not result in reliable preditions.


I think there are something like 70 eye features in the CLM model. Is that useful or noise? 
I'd like to be able to test with synthetic eye features to see how well regression works.
I'd like to be able to test the real data to see if any of the 70 features are extraneous.


The regression data window of 700 items means that any training not inside that window (older training) is lost/forgotten.  This can't be right.


Can I somehow compare the click position going in to the position coming out? They might not even be in the same coordinate system.


Hangup Functionality
All tracks are stopped and the room is deleted when either side hangs up.  Why?  

I'd need to know more to know if it is possible to reconnect to the same room.  Investigate.

Note that the code attempts to delete the room, but they clearly exist in the DB still, so that's
not working anyway.
